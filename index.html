                        Over the course of the past 15 years I have worked for several
                        companies in various web developer roles. This has involved the
                        maintenance and continued development of commercial web sites
                        and online products. I currently work for a company called

                    <p>
                        I have commercial experience working with technologies such as
                        C#, .NET, Node.js, JavaScript and React. This has involved
                        personally developing architecture and applications and also, in
                        my more senior roles, guiding and assisting other developers. I
                        currently work in a development environment that employs an
                        agile approach using the Scrum framework. This includes test
                        driven development, code reviews and continuous deployment.

                    <p>
                        My aim for the future is to expand on the knowledge base I
                        currently have and continue to be involved in the architecture
                        and design of web based applications from the ground up.
