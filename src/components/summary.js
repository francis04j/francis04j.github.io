        Welcome to my online curriculum vitae.
        Here you will get a detailed insight into my work experience, skills,
        certifications and education.
        My professioal journey started as an intern web services developer, a decade ago
        and since then I have worked for several companies in various developer roles.
        This has involved the creation, maintenance and continued development of commercial web sites
        and online APIs. I currently work for a company called
                        <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publicis Sapient</a>, who are experts in helping establised organizations by partnering with
                        them to their future, digitally-enabled state, both in the way they work and the way they serve their customers
                    </p>
    <p>
        I have commercial experience working with technologies such as
        C#, .NET, Node.js, JavaScript and Python.
        Apart from coding, i've been involved giving talks, demos to clients,
        assisting and sometimes mentoring other developers.
                    </p>
    <p>
        My aim for the future is to expand on the knowledge base I
        currently have and continue to be involved in the architecture
        and design of applications from the ground up.
                    </p>
